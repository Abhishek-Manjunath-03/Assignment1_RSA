# Group 6 - Boolean Logic Simulator
by Amogh Hemanth Likith Naresh Abhishek

## Description
The Boolean Logic Simulator is a simple tool that allows users to input different types of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and compute the output based on the given inputs. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in electronics engineering and programming.

## Problem Statement
The task is to develop a Boolean Logic Simulator that allows users to compute outputs based on various logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. The simulator should feature a user-friendly interface for inputting gate types and boolean values, along with robust input validation to ensure correct data entry. It should involve implementing basic logic gate functions, creating a simple command-line or web interface, and writing comprehensive tests to verify the functionality of the logic gates. 

## Steps
We created the repository "Assignment1_RSA" and gave access to our group members as contributers and assigned the works for each of us.

## Objective
Task is to implement the core functionality for basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. These gates perform the fundamental operations used in digital circuits.

AND Gate:
The AND gate takes two binary inputs (0 or 1). It returns 1 if both inputs are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
Example: For inputs (1, 1), the output will be 1. For inputs (1, 0), the output will be 0.

OR Gate:
The OR gate also takes two binary inputs. It returns 1 if at least one of the inputs is 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
Example: For inputs (1, 0), the output will be 1. For inputs (0, 0), the output will be 0.

NOT Gate:
The NOT gate takes only one input. It inverts the input, so if the input is 1, the output will be 0, and if the input is 0, the output will be 1.
Example: For input 1, the output will be 0. For input 0, the output will be 1.

XOR Gate:
The XOR (Exclusive OR) gate takes two binary inputs. It returns 1 if the inputs are different (i.e., one is 1 and the other is 0); otherwise, it returns 0.
Example: For inputs (1, 0), the output will be 1. For inputs (1, 1), the output will be
