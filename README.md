# Group 6 - Boolean Logic Simulator
by Amogh Hemanth Likith Naresh Abhishek

## Description
The Boolean Logic Simulator is a simple tool that allows users to input different types of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and compute the output based on the given inputs. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in electronics engineering and programming.

## Problem Statement
The task is to develop a Boolean Logic Simulator that allows users to compute outputs based on various logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. The simulator should feature a user-friendly interface for inputting gate types and boolean values, along with robust input validation to ensure correct data entry. It should involve implementing basic logic gate functions, creating a simple command-line or web interface, and writing comprehensive tests to verify the functionality of the logic gates. 

## Steps
We created the repository "Assignment1_RSA" and gave access to our group members as contributers and assigned the works for each of us.
